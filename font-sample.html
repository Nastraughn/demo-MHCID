    <h1 class="lede">Once upon a time, before MHCID C4...</h1>
    <p class="copy">There was a young man studying economics and psychology at an Ivy League institution, because he thought it would help him make money to pay off his student loans.</p>
    <p class="copy">"Huzzah!" he cried when he accepted his first job offer in the lovely San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
    <p class="copy">But allas, he quickly realized that 'twas not the field for him. </p>
    <p class="copy">So, he went back to his roots. He began drawing and sketching product concepts again. Like he used to do before being jaded by classmates seeking high-paying jobs on Wall Street. And before he knew it, he was accepted and enrolled in the MHCID program at UC Irvine!</p>
